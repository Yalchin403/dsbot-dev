Primary purpose of this project was to just get an experience when it comes to writing bots, doesn't matter whether it's telegram bot or discord bot or whatever. But then as I already have discord server, I thought why to use other's bot, and why not maing my own for my own server, and kick all the other bots. So I created this project and completed about 1 week. Ofc I think I can imporve it the way better, as the bot is kinda static and not so customizable for any other server rather than my own. But it can definitely be made more dynamic with just a little effort. Also I used JSON file to store some data, which is not much data. That was the whole reason why I didn't use database, But ofc can easily be connected.
