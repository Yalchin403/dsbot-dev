Primary purpose of this project was to just get an experience when it comes to writing bots, doesn't matter whether it's telegram bot or discord bot or whatever. But then as I already have discord server, I thought why to use other's bot, and why not making my own for my own server, and kick all the other bots. So I created the bot and completed about 1 week. But the bot was not using cogs and more importantly I was not using database, instead I was just writing all the data to the JSON file, which cannot be as efficient as databases in terms of retrieving the data or inserting and so on. So in this project, I connected postgresql database and I divided one large file into cogs, which will keep the overall structure clean, and will also make the updating procedure the way easier (as we do not need to restart whole bot for one minor change instead we need to reload specific cog). Just FYI, this bot is not in the production yet,but will be soon, after I make some improvement, however previous version (which is not using database and cogs) is in the production. You can take a look at it by visiting [my server](https://discord.gg/JUcnWDJcdC).
